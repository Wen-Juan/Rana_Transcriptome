### Files herein include:

"TE_repeats.fasta"                        - This file contains the dnaPipeTE contigs (i.e. the repeat library), this is the last assembly performed with Trinity
"one_RM_hit_per_repeatsequence_contigs"   - Sorted RepeatMasker output containing the best hit on repbase for each of the dnaPipeTE contigs (TE_repeats.fasta)
"Best_RM_annot_80_80"	                    - Subset of the previous table, including contigs for which at least 80% of the sequence is mapping to at least 80% percent of the target sequence
"Best_RM_annot_partial"	                  - Same but for contigs for which at least 80% of the sequence is mapping to less than 80% percent of the target sequence
